# Support Us

## Supporters and Patrons

The Lansing Bike Co-op would like to acknowledge and thank the following organizations for their support. If not for their generosity we would not be here today. We commend the tireless work they do to strengthen the bicycle community both in our city and throughout our state.

### Tri-County Bicycle Association

In 2014, the Tri-County Bicycle Association gave us our first grant for $1,200 to purchase tools and begin to set up shop. The following year they gave us $3,500 to improve the infrastructure of our building, allowing us to expand our open hours.

To date, the TCBA have given away more than 1.5 million dollars to groups, clubs and organizations throughout Michigan in an effort to improve bicycle accessibility. For more information or to join as a member please visit www.biketcba.org

### League of Michigan Bicyclists

In 2017 the League of Michigan Bicyclists gave us a grant of $1,000 allowing us to establish a scholarship fund for individuals who would like to take our classes but lacked the financial resources to do so. The following year they granted us $1,000 more to purchase a pull behind trailer allowing us to further our community outreach efforts.

When it comes to advancing the cause of bicycle safety in Michigan, LMB is leading the way. Their mission is to promote bicycling and the safety of all bicyclists on Michigan roadways. Cooperating with state and local agencies and other like-minded groups toward this goal, LMB is making Michigan bicycling better.
