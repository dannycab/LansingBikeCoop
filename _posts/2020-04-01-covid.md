In light of the Covid-19 pandemic we were forced to cancel our spring fundraiser. We hope to reschedule a fundraiser and resume normal operations as soon as it is deemed to be safe. We ask that everyone do their part to keep each other protected by following recommended guidelines in regards to washing our hands and maintaining a safe and strict social distance of at least six feet. We hope to see you all soon. Be well.
