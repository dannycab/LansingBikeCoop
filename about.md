# Help Us Buy The Building

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic we were forced to cancel our spring fundraiser. We hope to reschedule a fundraiser and resume normal operations as soon as it is deemed to be safe. We ask that everyone do their part to keep each other protected by following recommended guidelines in regards to washing our hands and maintaining a safe and strict social distance of at least six feet. We hope to see you all soon. Be well.

# Mission Statement:

The Lansing Bike Co-op empowers our community through bicycle education and access. We provide a welcoming space for taking transportation into our own hands.

The idea behind a bike co-op is a simple one. Provide a space where anyone regardless of race, color, national origin, spiritual belief, age, gender, sexual orientation or physical ability can come and learn the skills necessary to fix and maintain their own bicycle.

We believe that giving people the tools, materials and knowledge to do the work themselves is a valuable community asset. Through that work the bicycle can become an important tool in the furtherance of individual empowerment.

The Lansing Bike Co-op is an all volunteer organization located at 1715 E. Kalamazoo. For our current hours please follow us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/LansingBikeCoop/).
